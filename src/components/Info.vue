  <h2>What Is An HD Wallet?</h2>
    <p>
      A HD Wallet is a special type of cryptocurrency wallet that can hold any
      type of cryptocurrency! Not only that but you can always recover your wallet
      with your mnemonic phrase, a set of 12 words that represent your wallet.
      HD wallets are more secure than traditional wallets because you can create
      unlimited number of wallets that aren't connected and not have to remember
      all of the private keys!
